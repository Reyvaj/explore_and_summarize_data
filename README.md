# explore_and_summarize_data
Use R to apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies.

## Pre-requisites
- You can use Rstudio to run the .rmd project file. You can download an open source version [here.](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
- Make sure you download the data file in this repository "wineQualityReds.csv"
- R libraries:
  - ggplot2
  - knitr
  - dplyr

## Getting Started
- Once you have installed R studio simply right click the .rmd file and open with Rstudio.
- To install the libraries, run the following code `install.packages("ggplot2")` and `library("ggplot2")` to load the library.
- Repeat the process with the other two libraries, knitr and dplyr.
- Load the data with the following code `reds <- read.csv('wineQualityReds.csv')`
- You can use my code to run a variety of visualizations or come up with your own.
